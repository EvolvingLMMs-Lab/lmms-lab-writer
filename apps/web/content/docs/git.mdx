# Git Integration

LMMs-Lab Writer has first-class Git support built into the sidebar. Stage files, review diffs, commit changes, and push to GitHub — all without leaving the editor.

## Getting Started

If your project folder is already a Git repository, the Git panel activates automatically. If not, click **Initialize Repository** to create one. The app generates a LaTeX-specific `.gitignore` file for you, excluding auxiliary files like `.aux`, `.log`, `.synctex.gz`, etc.

## The Git Panel

Click the **Git** icon in the sidebar to open the panel.

### Branch Info

The panel header shows your current branch name. If you have a remote configured, it also shows how many commits you're ahead or behind.

### Changed Files

Files are organized into two sections:

- **Staged** — Files ready to be committed
- **Unstaged** — Modified, added, or deleted files not yet staged

Each file shows a status badge:

| Badge | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **M** | Modified |
| **A** | Added (new file) |
| **D** | Deleted |
| **R** | Renamed |
| **?** | Untracked |

### File Actions

Hover over a file to see action buttons:

- **+** — Stage the file (or unstage if already staged)
- **Discard** — Revert changes (with confirmation for destructive operations)

Click a file to open a **side-by-side diff** view showing exactly what changed.

### Bulk Actions

- **Unstage All** — Remove all files from the staging area
- **Discard All** — Revert all changes (confirmation dialog)

## Committing

1. Stage the files you want to include
2. Write a commit message in the input box
3. Press **Ctrl+Enter** (or **Cmd+Enter** on macOS) or click **Commit**

### AI Commit Messages

Click the **sparkle icon** next to the commit button to generate a commit message from your staged changes using AI. The generated message summarizes what changed across all staged files.

## Push & Pull

- **Push** — Push your local commits to the remote. Handles initial branch setup automatically.
- **Pull** — Pull changes from the remote.

The button labels show the number of commits ahead/behind when a remote is configured.

## Remote Setup

If your repository doesn't have a remote:

1. **Manual** — Enter a remote URL (e.g., `git@github.com:user/repo.git`)
2. **Publish to GitHub** — Create a new GitHub repository and push in one step (requires [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/))

### GitHub CLI Authentication

For one-click GitHub publishing, install the GitHub CLI and authenticate:

```bash
gh auth login
```

The app uses browser-based device code authentication — no tokens to manage.

## Commit History

The bottom of the Git panel shows recent commits with:

- Commit message
- Author name
- Relative timestamp (e.g., *"2 hours ago"*)
- Abbreviated commit hash (click to copy)

Click **Show more commits** to load additional history.

## Tips

- **Review AI edits before committing** — After AI tools modify your files, use the diff view to verify changes
- **Commit frequently** — Small, focused commits make it easy to revert bad AI edits
- **Use meaningful messages** — Or let AI generate them for you with the sparkle button
- **`.gitignore` is auto-generated** — When you initialize a repo, the app creates a LaTeX-specific `.gitignore` so auxiliary files don't clutter your repository
