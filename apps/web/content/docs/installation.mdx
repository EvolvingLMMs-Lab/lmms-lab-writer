# Installation

LMMs-Lab Writer is available for macOS and Windows.

## Download

Visit the [download page](/download) to get the latest version for your platform.

### macOS

#### Homebrew (Recommended)

The easiest way to install on macOS is via Homebrew — no security warnings, and auto-updates built in:

```bash
brew tap EvolvingLMMs-Lab/tap
brew install --cask lmms-lab-writer
```

To update later:

```bash
brew upgrade lmms-lab-writer
```

#### Manual Installation

Two formats are available from the [download page](/download):

- **DMG** (`.dmg`) — Drag-and-drop installation. Open the image and drag the app to your Applications folder.
- **PKG** (`.pkg`) — Guided installer. Double-click and follow the wizard.

Both are for **Apple Silicon** (M1/M2/M3/M4).

Since the app is not yet signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS will block it. Remove the quarantine attribute first:

```bash
# For DMG
xattr -cr ~/Downloads/LMMs-Lab\ Writer_*.dmg

# For PKG
xattr -cr ~/Downloads/LMMs-Lab_Writer_*.pkg
```

Then open the file and install normally.

> **Alternative**: Right-click the downloaded file → select **Open** → click **Open** in the dialog → proceed with installation.

### Windows

1. Download `LMMs-Lab Writer_x.x.x_x64-setup.exe` (recommended) or the `.msi` installer from the [download page](/download).

2. Run the installer and follow the prompts.

3. Launch from the **Start Menu** or desktop shortcut.

> **Note**: Windows SmartScreen may show a warning because the app is not yet code-signed. Click **More info** → **Run anyway** to proceed.

## Requirements

### LaTeX Distribution

A LaTeX distribution is required to compile documents. The app auto-detects your installation and will prompt you if none is found.

**macOS**:

| Distribution | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) | ~150 MB | Lightweight, auto-installs missing packages. Recommended for most users. |
| [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) | ~5 GB | Full TeX Live distribution. Includes everything out of the box. |
| [BasicTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html) | ~100 MB | Minimal TeX Live. You may need to install extra packages manually. |

**Windows**:

| Distribution | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) | ~150 MB | Lightweight, auto-installs missing packages. Recommended for most users. |
| [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) | ~200 MB | Auto-installs missing packages on first use. Popular choice on Windows. |
| [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) | ~5 GB | Full distribution. Includes everything out of the box. |

### Supported LaTeX Engines

The app supports these compilation engines:

- **pdfLaTeX** — Standard engine, fastest compilation
- **XeLaTeX** — Native Unicode support, can use system fonts (recommended for CJK)
- **LuaLaTeX** — Modern, programmable engine with Lua scripting
- **Latexmk** — Automated build tool that runs LaTeX the correct number of times

All engines are auto-detected from your LaTeX distribution.

### Git (Optional)

For version control features (staging, committing, diffing, pushing):

- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

For GitHub integration (creating repos, publishing directly from the app):

- Install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)

## Build from Source

LMMs-Lab Writer is open source. To build from source you need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 20.0.0
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 10.x
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) toolchain (for Tauri)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-lab-writer.git
cd lmms-lab-writer
pnpm install
pnpm tauri:build
```

The built app will be in `apps/desktop/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`:

- **macOS**: `macos/LMMs-Lab Writer.app`
- **Windows**: `nsis/LMMs-Lab Writer_*-setup.exe`

## Updating

The app includes a built-in updater that notifies you when new versions are available. You can also check manually from the [releases page](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-lab-writer/releases).

If you installed via Homebrew, run:

```bash
brew upgrade lmms-lab-writer
