## Requirements

### LaTeX Distribution

You need a LaTeX distribution installed to compile documents. The app will detect your installed distribution automatically and prompt you if none is found.

- **macOS**: [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) (recommended) or [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
- **Windows**: [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) (recommended) or [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
- **Linux**: `sudo apt install texlive-full` (Debian/Ubuntu) or equivalent for your distro

Supported LaTeX engines:
- **pdfLaTeX** - Standard engine, fastest compilation
- **XeLaTeX** - Unicode support, system fonts
- **LuaLaTeX** - Programmable, modern features

All engines are managed through `latexmk` for automated compilation.

### Git (Optional)

For version control features (staging, committing, diffing, pushing), install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

For GitHub integration (creating repos, publishing), install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).
