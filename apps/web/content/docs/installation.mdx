# Installation

LMMs-Lab Writer is available for macOS and Windows.

## Download

Visit the [download page](/download) to get the latest version for your platform.

### macOS

#### Homebrew (Recommended)

The easiest way to install on macOS is via Homebrew — no security warnings, and auto-updates built in:

```bash
brew tap EvolvingLMMs-Lab/tap
brew install --cask lmms-lab-writer
```

To update later:

```bash
brew upgrade lmms-lab-writer
```

#### Manual Installation

1. Download `LMMs-Lab_Writer_x.x.x_aarch64.pkg` (Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3/M4) from the [download page](/download).

2. Since the app is not yet signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS will block it. Remove the quarantine attribute first:

```bash
xattr -cr ~/Downloads/LMMs-Lab_Writer_*.pkg
```

3. Double-click the `.pkg` file and follow the installer.

4. Launch **LMMs-Lab Writer** from your Applications folder.

> **Alternative**: Right-click the `.pkg` file → select **Open** → click **Open** in the dialog → follow the installer.

### Windows

1. Download `LMMs-Lab Writer_x.x.x_x64-setup.exe` (recommended) or the `.msi` installer from the [download page](/download).

2. Run the installer and follow the prompts.

3. Launch from the **Start Menu** or desktop shortcut.

> **Note**: Windows SmartScreen may show a warning because the app is not yet code-signed. Click **More info** → **Run anyway** to proceed.

## Requirements

### LaTeX Distribution

A LaTeX distribution is required to compile documents. The app auto-detects your installation and will prompt you if none is found.

**macOS**:

| Distribution | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) | ~150 MB | Lightweight, auto-installs missing packages. Recommended for most users. |
| [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) | ~5 GB | Full TeX Live distribution. Includes everything out of the box. |
| [BasicTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html) | ~100 MB | Minimal TeX Live. You may need to install extra packages manually. |

**Windows**:

| Distribution | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) | ~150 MB | Lightweight, auto-installs missing packages. Recommended for most users. |
| [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) | ~200 MB | Auto-installs missing packages on first use. Popular choice on Windows. |
| [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) | ~5 GB | Full distribution. Includes everything out of the box. |

### Supported LaTeX Engines

The app supports these compilation engines:

- **pdfLaTeX** — Standard engine, fastest compilation
- **XeLaTeX** — Native Unicode support, can use system fonts (recommended for CJK)
- **LuaLaTeX** — Modern, programmable engine with Lua scripting
- **Latexmk** — Automated build tool that runs LaTeX the correct number of times

All engines are auto-detected from your LaTeX distribution.

### Git (Optional)

For version control features (staging, committing, diffing, pushing):

- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

For GitHub integration (creating repos, publishing directly from the app):

- Install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)

## Build from Source
