# Quick Start

This guide gets you from zero to a compiled PDF with AI assistance in under 5 minutes.

## 1. Open a Project

Launch LMMs-Lab Writer and click **Open Folder** to select a directory containing your LaTeX files.

If you're starting fresh:

- Create a new folder anywhere on your machine
- Add a `main.tex` file (the app will auto-detect it as the main file)
- Or clone an existing repository using the built-in terminal

The app watches your project directory for changes — any file created or modified (by you, by AI, or by any other tool) will appear in the file tree instantly.

## 2. Write LaTeX

Click any `.tex`, `.bib`, or other text file in the file tree to open it in the editor.

The editor provides:

- **Syntax highlighting** for LaTeX, BibTeX, and many other languages
- **Bracket matching** and auto-closing
- **Line numbers** with code folding
- **Vim mode** (toggle in Settings)
- **Customizable font size**, line height, tab size, and word wrap

You can configure all editor settings from the Settings dialog.

## 3. Compile

Click the **Compile** button in the toolbar to build your PDF.

The app supports four compilation modes:

| Engine | Best for |
|---|---|
| **pdfLaTeX** | Standard documents, fastest compilation |
| **XeLaTeX** | Unicode text, system fonts, CJK languages |
| **LuaLaTeX** | Modern features, Lua scripting |
| **Latexmk** | Automated multi-pass builds (bibliography, cross-references) |

To change the engine or set the main file, open the **LaTeX Settings** dialog from the toolbar. The app auto-detects your main `.tex` file based on the presence of `\documentclass` and `\begin{document}`.

Compilation errors and warnings appear in the output panel with line numbers so you can jump directly to the issue.

## 4. Use AI

The real power of LMMs-Lab Writer is AI integration. Because your files are local, any AI tool with filesystem access can edit them directly — and changes appear in the editor in real-time.

### OpenCode (Built-in)

The built-in AI panel powered by [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode):

1. Click the **AI panel** icon in the sidebar
2. Type your prompt (e.g., *"Write the abstract summarizing our key contributions"*)
3. Watch the AI edit your files in real-time
4. Review changes and compile

You can attach files, switch models, and manage multiple chat sessions. See the [OpenCode docs](/docs/opencode) for details.

### Claude Code

Run [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) in the built-in terminal:

```bash
claude "Add a related work section comparing our method to LoRA and QLoRA"
```

Changes appear instantly in the editor as Claude writes them.

### Cursor

Open your project folder in [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) alongside LMMs-Lab Writer. Edits made in Cursor appear in the editor in real-time thanks to file watching.

### Any AI Tool

If an AI tool can read and write files on your filesystem, it works with LMMs-Lab Writer. The app detects all file changes and reflects them instantly.

## 5. Review & Commit

Use the built-in **Git panel** in the sidebar:

1. Click the **Git** icon to see changed files
2. Click a file to view the diff
3. Stage files with the **+** button
4. Write a commit message (or click the **sparkle icon** to generate one with AI)
5. Press **Ctrl+Enter** or click **Commit**
6. Push to remote with the **Push** button

You can also initialize new repositories, publish to GitHub, and manage remotes — all from the Git panel. See the [Git docs](/docs/git) for details.

## 6. Use the Terminal

The built-in terminal gives you full shell access:

- **macOS**: Bash or Zsh (your default shell)
- **Windows**: PowerShell

Run any command — install packages, use CLI tools, run scripts. The terminal respects your app's light/dark theme.
