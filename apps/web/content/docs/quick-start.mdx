# Quick Start

This guide will help you get started with LMMs-Lab Writer in under 5 minutes.

## 1. Open a Project

Launch LMMs-Lab Writer and click **Open Folder** to select a directory containing your LaTeX project.

If you don't have an existing project, you can:

- Clone an existing repository using the built-in terminal
- Create a new folder and add a `main.tex` file
- Open a recent project from the home screen

## 2. Write LaTeX

The editor supports standard LaTeX syntax with:

- **Syntax highlighting** - CodeMirror-based editor with LaTeX grammar
- **Code completion** - Auto-complete for common LaTeX commands
- **Error detection** - Real-time compilation error reporting with line numbers
- **File tree** - Navigate your project files with drag-and-drop support

Click any `.tex`, `.bib`, or other file in the file tree to open it in the editor.

## 3. Compile

Click the **Compile** button or use the keyboard shortcut to compile your document.

The app supports three LaTeX engines:

- **pdfLaTeX** - Standard, fastest
- **XeLaTeX** - Unicode & system fonts (default)
- **LuaLaTeX** - Programmable, modern

You can change the engine and configure compilation settings in the LaTeX settings dialog. The app auto-detects your main `.tex` file, or you can set it manually.

## 4. Use AI

The real power of LMMs-Lab Writer comes from AI integration. Your files are local, so any AI tool with file access can edit them directly.

### Claude Code

Run Claude Code in a terminal alongside the app. It can edit your `.tex` files directly:

```bash
claude "Add a related work section comparing our method to LoRA and QLoRA"
```

Changes appear instantly in the editor as Claude writes them.

### Cursor

Open your project folder in Cursor alongside LMMs-Lab Writer. Edits made in Cursor will appear in the editor in real-time thanks to file watching.

### OpenCode (Built-in)

Use the built-in OpenCode panel for AI assistance directly in the app:

1. Click the AI panel icon in the sidebar
2. Type your prompt (e.g., "Write the conclusion section summarizing key findings")
3. Watch the AI edit your files in real-time
4. Review changes and compile

### Codex CLI

Use OpenAI's Codex CLI for batch edits:

```bash
codex "Fix all citation formatting in main.tex and add missing references to refs.bib"
```

### Any AI Tool

If an AI tool can edit files on your filesystem, it works with LMMs-Lab Writer. The app watches your project directory and reflects changes instantly.

## 5. Review & Commit

Use the built-in Git panel to review and commit your changes:

1. Click the **Git** icon in the sidebar to see changed files
2. Click on a file to see the diff
3. Stage files by clicking the **+** button
4. Write a commit message and click **Commit**
5. Push to remote with the **Push** button

You can also use the built-in terminal for advanced Git operations:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add conclusion section via Claude"
git push
```

### Publishing to GitHub

If your project isn't on GitHub yet, use the **Publish to GitHub** dialog to create a new repository and push your code in one step.

## 6. Configure Settings

### LaTeX Engine

Open LaTeX Settings to:
- Choose between pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX, or LuaLaTeX
- Set the main file for compilation
- Clean auxiliary files

### Terminal

The built-in terminal gives you full shell access for any command-line operations - running scripts, installing packages, or using CLI tools.
