## 1. Open a Project

Launch LMMs-Lab Writer and click **Open Folder** to select a directory containing your LaTeX project.

If you don't have an existing project, you can:

## 2. Write LaTeX

The editor supports standard LaTeX syntax with:

- Syntax highlighting

- Error detection

## 3. Compile

Press `Cmd+S` (macOS) or `Ctrl+S` (Windows/Linux) to save and compile your document.

The PDF preview will update automatically.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude "Add a conclusion section summarizing the key findings"
```
