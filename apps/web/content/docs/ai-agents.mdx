# AI Agents

LMMs-Lab Writer is designed to work with **any AI tool that can edit files**. Because your project files are local, AI agents can read and write them directly — no copy-paste, no plugins, no workarounds.

The editor watches your project directory and reflects all file changes in real-time, no matter which tool made the change.

## Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) is Anthropic's CLI tool that gives Claude direct access to your filesystem.

### Setup

Install Claude Code:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Usage

Open the built-in terminal in LMMs-Lab Writer and run Claude Code from your project directory:

```bash
# Write a new section
claude "Add a related work section comparing our method to LoRA, QLoRA, and adapters"

# Fix errors
claude "Fix the compilation errors in main.tex"

# Edit bibliography
claude "Add missing BibTeX entries for all \cite commands that don't have corresponding entries in refs.bib"

# Restructure
claude "Split the methodology section into three subsections: Problem Setup, Our Approach, and Theoretical Analysis"
```

Changes appear in the editor as Claude writes them. You can watch the edits happen in real-time, then compile to see the result.

### Tips

- Claude Code has full context of your project — it can read all files, not just the one you mention
- Use specific, detailed prompts for better results
- After edits, use the Git panel to review changes before committing

## Cursor

[Cursor](https://cursor.com/) is an AI-powered code editor that works well alongside LMMs-Lab Writer.

### Setup

1. Install Cursor
2. Open your LaTeX project folder in both Cursor and LMMs-Lab Writer

### Usage

Use Cursor's AI features (Cmd+K, inline edits, chat) to edit your `.tex` files. Every change Cursor makes is instantly reflected in LMMs-Lab Writer's editor. Compile in LMMs-Lab Writer to see the PDF output.

This gives you the best of both worlds — Cursor's AI editing and LMMs-Lab Writer's LaTeX compilation and preview.

## Codex CLI

[Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) by OpenAI works similarly to Claude Code:

```bash
codex "Fix all citation formatting in main.tex and add missing references to refs.bib"
```

## Other Tools

Any tool that can edit files on your filesystem works with LMMs-Lab Writer:

- **Aider** — AI pair-programming in the terminal
- **Continue** — Open-source AI coding assistant
- **Windsurf** — AI-powered editor
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** — GitHub's AI assistant

The pattern is always the same: the AI tool edits your `.tex` files, and LMMs-Lab Writer detects the changes instantly.

## Why Local-First Matters for AI

Traditional cloud-based LaTeX editors (like Overleaf) lock your files on a remote server. AI tools can't access them directly, forcing you to copy-paste between browser tabs.

With local files:

- AI agents read your entire project for full context
- Edits happen directly — no copy-paste, no formatting loss
- Multiple AI tools can work on the same project
- You maintain full version control with Git
- Everything works offline
