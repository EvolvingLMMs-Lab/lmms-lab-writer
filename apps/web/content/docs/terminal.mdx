# Terminal

LMMs-Lab Writer includes a full-featured terminal emulator, so you never need to leave the app for command-line tasks.

## Overview

The built-in terminal uses [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) and connects to a real shell process via Tauri's PTY (pseudo-terminal) integration. It's not a simple command runner — it's a fully interactive terminal with support for colors, cursor movement, tab completion, and everything you'd expect from a native terminal.

## Default Shell

The terminal uses your system's default shell:

- **macOS**: Bash or Zsh (whichever is your default)
- **Windows**: PowerShell

You can switch to a custom shell path in the terminal settings.

## Features

- **Full shell access** — Run any command, install packages, use CLI tools
- **Color support** — ANSI colors rendered correctly
- **Scrollback** — 10,000 lines of history
- **Auto-resize** — Adapts to window size changes
- **Theme-aware** — Matches the app's light/dark mode
- **Monospace font** — SF Mono (macOS), Cascadia Code (Windows)

## Common Use Cases

### Running AI CLI Tools

```bash
# Claude Code
claude "Rewrite the introduction to be more compelling"

# Codex CLI
codex "Add error bars to all figures in the results section"
```

### LaTeX Package Management

```bash
# TinyTeX
tlmgr install <package-name>

# MiKTeX (Windows)
mpm --install <package-name>
```

### Git Operations

While the Git panel handles most operations, the terminal is useful for advanced git workflows:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
git stash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

### Running Scripts

```bash
python scripts/generate_figures.py
bash scripts/build_appendix.sh
```

## Settings

Open **Settings** to configure the terminal:

- **Shell mode**: Auto (system default) or Custom
- **Custom shell path**: Specify a custom shell executable (e.g., `/bin/fish`, `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`)
