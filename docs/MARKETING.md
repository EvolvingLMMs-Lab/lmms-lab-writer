## Product Hunt Launch

### Tagline (60 chars max)

```
AI-native LaTeX editor. Let Claude write your papers.
```

### Description (260 chars max)

```
Stop wrestling with LaTeX syntax. LMMs-Lab Writer is a local-first LaTeX editor designed for AI pair-programming. Your files stay on your machine while Claude, Cursor, and Codex edit them directly. Free, open-source, and built for researchers.
```

### Longer Description

```
The Problem:
You're a researcher. You should be thinking about your next breakthrough - not wrestling with LaTeX syntax, citation formatting, or figure placement.

Every hour spent on \begin{figure}[htbp] is an hour not spent on your actual work.

The Solution:
LMMs-Lab Writer is a local-first LaTeX editor designed for AI pair-programming. Your files stay on your machine. AI tools edit directly. You compile and commit locally.

How it works:
1. Open your LaTeX project folder
2. Tell Claude: "Add a related work section comparing our method to LoRA"
3. Watch it edit main.tex in real-time
4. Hit compile. Done.

Features:
✓ Local-first - your files never leave your machine
✓ AI-native - designed for Claude, Cursor, Codex
✓ Real-time preview
✓ Git integration (first-class, not an afterthought)
✓ Built-in terminal
✓ Fast local compilation
✓ Free and open source

Why local-first?
Overleaf locks your files in the cloud. AI tools can't access them.
With local files, AI works naturally - just like a colleague sitting next to you.
```

### First Comment (for Product Hunt)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Name] from LMMs-Lab. We built this because we were frustrated.

As researchers, we spend way too much time on LaTeX formatting instead of actual research. When AI tools like Claude became amazing at writing, we tried using them for papers - but it was awkward. Copy-paste between Overleaf and ChatGPT. Broken formatting. No version control.

So we built the editor we wished existed:
- Your files stay local (on YOUR machine)
- AI tools can edit directly (no copy-paste)
- Git is built-in (no $15/month Overleaf premium)
- Fast local compilation (no server queue)

It's free, open-source (MIT), and available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

We'd love your feedback! What features would make this more useful for your workflow?

## Twitter/X Launch Thread

### Thread 1 - Main Launch

```
🧵 We built an open-source LaTeX editor that lets AI write your papers.

Here's the problem:

You're a researcher.
You should be thinking about breakthroughs.
Instead you're wrestling with \begin{figure}[htbp]

Every hour on LaTeX syntax = 1 hour NOT on your research.

---

The solution: LMMs-Lab Writer

Your files stay on YOUR machine.
Claude/Cursor/Codex edit DIRECTLY.
You compile and commit LOCALLY.

No cloud lock-in.
No $15/month.
No copy-paste gymnastics.

---

[Insert Demo Video/GIF here]

Watch Claude write a Related Work section in 2 minutes.

---

How it works:

1. Open your LaTeX project
2. Tell Claude: "Add a section comparing our method to LoRA"
3. Watch it edit main.tex in real-time
4. Hit compile. Done.

That's it.

Why local-first matters:

Overleaf = files locked in cloud = AI can't access them
You = copy-pasting between browser tabs

LMMs-Lab Writer = your files, your machine = AI works naturally

---

Features:

✓ Real-time LaTeX preview
✓ Git integration (first-class)
✓ Built-in terminal
✓ OpenCode AI panel
✓ PDF preview
✓ Fast local compilation
✓ Works offline

### Thread 2 - Building in Public

```
We're building an AI-native LaTeX editor.

Here's what we learned in the first week:

🧵 Thread

---

Lesson 1: Local-first is non-negotiable.

Researchers need:
- Offline access (airports, conferences)
- Git integration (version control)
- Fast compilation (no server queue)
- AI access to files

Cloud editors can't do all of this.

---

Lesson 2: The real competition isn't Overleaf.

It's copy-paste.

Researchers are already using AI for writing.
They're just doing it painfully:
- Copy text to ChatGPT
- Generate content
- Paste back
- Fix formatting
- Repeat

We're removing the friction.

---

Lesson 3: Git matters more than you think.

For researchers:
- Track changes for revisions
- Collaborate with co-authors
- Revert bad AI edits
- Submit to arXiv/journals

Overleaf charges $21/mo for Git sync.
We made it free and first-class.

---

Lesson 4: Speed creates magic.

Local compilation:
- 2-3 seconds for most documents
- No waiting for server
- Instant feedback loop

When AI edits → you see results instantly.
That tight loop is addictive.

---

What's next:

[ ] AI-powered citation suggestions
[ ] Template gallery for top conferences
[ ] Collaborative editing (without cloud lock-in)
[ ] Better error explanations

Follow along as we build in public.

## LinkedIn Post

```
I spent 3 years formatting LaTeX papers.

Tables. Figures. Citations. The \usepackage dance.

Last month, I watched a colleague use Claude to write an entire Related Work section in 10 minutes.

One problem: Claude couldn't access his Overleaf project.

So he was copy-pasting between browser tabs.

That's when it hit me:

The future of academic writing isn't cloud editors.
It's local files + AI with direct access.

We built LMMs-Lab Writer:
- Your files stay on your machine
- Claude/Cursor/Codex edit directly
- Git is built-in (not an afterthought)
- Compile locally (no queue)
- Free and open source

The result: researchers focus on RESEARCH, not formatting.
